# Weather-App

## Overview
* A python-based weather application that allows the user to enter a city and country to get weather-based data about that location from https://openweathermap.org/.
* All parts of the application are displayed using Tkinter to provide an easy-to-interpret / easy-to-use GUI for the user.
* The displayed data includes:
    * The name of the city.
    * The name of the country.
    * The current temperature.
    * The maximum temperature.
    * The minimum temperature.
    * The 'main' weather event (i.e. overcast, cloudy etc.).
    * A description of the weather (i.e. light rain etc.).
    * An icon that describes the current weather.
 * The current, maximum, and minimum temperatures are displayed as a dial, with the minimum temperature at one end of the dial and the maximum temperature at another end of the dial, thereby effectively showing the user the range of temperatures for that location.

## Current status
* At the moment, the app is fully functional (with the features outlined above) to provide weather data to the user about a given location.
* In the future, I may add more features:
    *  Ability to save locations viewed in the past.
    *  Have an image be displayed of the location in addition to the weather data.
    * Ability to also book travel arrangements (i.e. based on weather etc) - using another API to provide these details.
